Welcome to Project 2. 

This was a change for me to deal with input and multiple Python scripts as well as utilizing imports. The files use a variety of imports including "Random" to generate a number. The project gives the user two options: a regular 1 - 100 guessing game that goes indefinitely until the number is correct or an extreme version of the application that goes from 1 - 10,000. 

The files must stay together as they need to be in the same folder in order to be called into the main script correctly.
